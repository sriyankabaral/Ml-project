## üìå Projects Included  

### üé¨ Movie Recommender (Content-Based)  
- **Goal:** Recommend movies/shows similar to a given title or based on user description.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (`description`, `genres`, `cast`).  
  - TF-IDF vectorization of text fields.  
  - Feature fusion with weights.  
  - Cosine similarity for recommendations.  
- **Features:**  
  - Recommend by movie title (if present in dataset).  
  - Recommend by free-text query (e.g., *‚Äúromantic comedy in New York‚Äù*).  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

### üöñ Uber Data Analysis  
- **Goal:** Analyze Uber ride data to find trends and insights.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): trips by day, hour, and location.  
  - Visualizations: heatmaps, bar plots, line plots.  
  - Feature extraction for demand forecasting.  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction 
- **Goal:** Predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data.  
- **Dataset:** Heart disease dataset with attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Data preprocessing and handling missing values.  
  - Feature scaling and selection.  
  - Classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.  
  - Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix.  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
